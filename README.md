# REPerfectionIT
This is a Vaadin based web application written in Java that contains two skill-building games: Reliatype and Reticentless. Reliatype is a challenging typing practice game that does not allow you to make any mistakes. Any wrong key will trigger a restart in the level so that you can build accuracy BEFORE speed. Reticentless is a vocabulary learning, memorization game that uses Selenium to webscrape various word generators. The use of the Selenium chrome driver causes that app to lose functionality when used as a web app, so only the offline version works.
